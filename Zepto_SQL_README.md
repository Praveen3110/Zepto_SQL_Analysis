## üß™ Data Exploration

### 1. View Sample Data
```sql
SELECT * FROM zepto;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Displays sample rows to understand the dataset structure.

### 2. Count total rows
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM zepto;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Total number of records in the table.

### 3. Add boolean stock column
```sql
ALTER TABLE zepto ADD COLUMN outstock BOOLEAN;
UPDATE zepto SET outstock = CASE 
    WHEN outofstock = "FALSE" THEN FALSE 
    WHEN outofstock = "TRUE" THEN TRUE 
END;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Converts `outOfStock` string values to a boolean field `outstock`.

### 4. Check for NULLs
```sql
SELECT * FROM zepto
WHERE category IS NULL OR name IS NULL OR ...;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Checks for missing values in the dataset.

### 5. Distinct product categories
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM zepto ORDER BY category;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Lists all unique product categories.

### 6. Count of in-stock vs out-of-stock products
```sql
SELECT COUNT(sku_id), 
       CASE WHEN outstock = FALSE THEN "available" 
            WHEN outstock = TRUE THEN "notavailable" END AS stock_status
FROM zepto
GROUP BY outstock;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Groups product counts based on stock status.

### 7. Products listed more than once
```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(sku_id) 
FROM zepto 
GROUP BY name 
HAVING COUNT(sku_id) > 1 
ORDER BY COUNT(sku_id) DESC;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Detects duplicate product entries.

## üßπ Data Cleaning

### 1. Check for MRP or discounted price being 0
```sql
SELECT * FROM zepto WHERE mrp = 0 OR discountedSellingPrice = 0;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Detects invalid pricing records.

### 2. Remove such invalid entries
```sql
DELETE FROM zepto WHERE mrp = 0 OR discountedSellingPrice = 0;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Cleans out erroneous product data.

### 3. Convert price from paisa to rupees
```sql
UPDATE zepto 
SET mrp = mrp / 100.0, discountedSellingPrice = discountedSellingPrice / 100.0;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Adjusts price format for better analysis.

## üìä Business Insights

### Q1: Top 10 best-value products by discount
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM zepto ORDER BY discountPercent DESC LIMIT 10;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Products offering the highest discounts.

### Q2: High MRP products that are out of stock
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp 
FROM zepto 
WHERE outstock IS TRUE AND mrp > 300 
ORDER BY mrp DESC;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Identifies expensive but unavailable products.

### Q3: Estimated revenue by category
```sql
SELECT SUM(discountedSellingPrice * availableQuantity) AS total_revenue, category 
FROM zepto 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Calculates revenue potential for each category.

### Q4: Products with high MRP but low discount
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp, discountPercent 
FROM zepto 
WHERE mrp > 500 AND discountPercent < 10 
ORDER BY mrp DESC, discountPercent DESC;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Filters premium products with small discounts.

### Q5: Top 5 categories by average discount
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ROUND(AVG(discountPercent), 2) AS avg_dis_price, category 
FROM zepto 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY avg_dis_price DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Shows which categories give highest average discounts.

### Q6: Price per gram for products >100g
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, ROUND((discountedSellingPrice / weightInGms), 2) AS price_per_grams 
FROM zepto 
WHERE weightInGms >= 100 
ORDER BY price_per_grams;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Helps assess cost efficiency per gram.

### Q7: Classify product sizes
```sql
SELECT name, weightInGms, 
       CASE 
           WHEN weightInGms < 1000 THEN "low"
           WHEN weightInGms < 5000 THEN "medium"
           ELSE "bulk" 
       END AS category_quantity 
FROM zepto;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Categorizes product size into low, medium, or bulk.

### Q8: Total inventory weight by category
```sql
SELECT SUM(weightInGms * availableQuantity) AS total_weight, category 
FROM zepto 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY total_weight DESC;
```
‚û°Ô∏è Total stock weight for each category.
